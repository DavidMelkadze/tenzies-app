# Tenzies Game 🎲

This is a **Tenzies dice game** built with **React** and **Vite** as part of a learning project from **Scrimba**.

## About the Project

Tenzies is a simple game where the goal is to **roll until all dice show the same number**.  
You can **click dice to hold them**, preventing their value from changing on subsequent rolls.

This project helped me practice:

- React **state management** with `useState`  
- **Mapping arrays** to components  
- **Conditional rendering and styling**  
- Using **unique IDs** with `nanoid`  
- Functional component structure  
- CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts

## How to Play

1. Roll the dice with the **"Roll Dice"** button  
2. Click on a die to **hold** its value  
3. Keep rolling until all dice show the **same number**
